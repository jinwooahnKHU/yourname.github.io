This is my first github blog post using Jekyll-theme!!
Hope it works well.
To add new posts, simply add a file in the 'posts' directory that follows the convention 
'YYYY-MM-DD-nameofposts.ext' and includes the necessary front matter.

And also, Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
def print_hi(name):
  print("hello", name)
print_hi('JinWoo Ahn')
```
